				<h2 id="vietnamwar">Vietnam War</h2>
				<blockquote>
				The Vietnam War, also known as the Second Indochina War,and known in Vietnam as Resistance War
				Against America was a war that occurred in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia from November 1,1955 to April 30,1975.
				It was the second of the Indochina Wars and was officially fought between North Vietnam
				and the government of South Vietnam. The North Vietnamese army was supported by the Soviet Union,
				China and other communist allies and the South Vietnamese armywas supported by the United States,
				South Korea, Australia, Thailand and other anti-communist allies. The war is therefore considered a Cold War-era proxy war. It ended in 1975 when communist forces
				seized control of Saigon, ending the Vietnam War, and the country was unified as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam
				the following year.

				<h2 id="controversy">Controversy around the Vietnam War</h2>
				<blockquote>
				During the course of the Vietnam War a large segment of the American population came to be
				opposed to U.S. involvement in South Vietnam. Public opinion steadily turned against the war
				following 1967 and by 1970 only a third of Americans believed that the U.S. had not made a mistake by sending troops to fight in Vietnam.Nearly a third of the American population were strongly against the war.
				Some advocates within the peace movement advocated a unilateral withdrawal of
				U.S. forces from Vietnam. One reason given for the withdrawal is that it would contribute to a lessening of tensions in the region and
				thus less human bloodshed. Growing opposition to the war in the United States led to bitter divisions among Americans, both before and
				after President Richard Nixon ordered the withdrawal of U.S. forces in 1973.

				<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath of the War</h2>
				<blockquote>
				The most immediate effect of the Vietnam War was the staggering death toll.
				The war killed an estimated 2 million Vietnamese civilians, 1.1 million North Vietnamese troops,
				200,000 South Vietnamese troops, and 58,000 U.S. troops. Those wounded in combat numbered tens of thousands more. In 1975, it
				appeared that the Vietnam War was a clear loss for the United States. But while much of Indochina did become Communist,
				validating the domino theory to an extent, the war left mostly psychological scars in the United States. It did not affect
				the United States’ status as a superpower, and though North Vietnam "won" the war, realizing Ho Chi Minh’s lifelong dream,
				Vietnam’s postwar period was filled with more fighting, poverty, and suffering for its people. Today, as capitalism makes
				inroads in Vietnam, one would hardly suspect that Communists won the war in 1975.
