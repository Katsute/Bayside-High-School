					<blockquote>
						<p>"On August 13, 1961, the Communist government of the German Democratic Republic (GDR, or East Germany)
						began to build a barbed wire and concrete "Antifascistischer Schutzwall," or "antifascist bulwark," between
						East and West Berlin. The official purpose of this Berlin Wall was to keep Western "fascists" from entering
						East Germany and undermining the socialist state, but it primarily served the objective of stemming mass defections
						from East to West. The Berlin Wall stood until November 9, 1989, when the head of the East German Communist Party announced
						that citizens of the GDR could cross the border whenever they pleased. That night, ecstatic crowds swarmed the wall. Some
						crossed freely into West Berlin, while others brought hammers and picks and began to chip away at the wall itself. To this
						day, the Berlin Wall remains one of the most powerful and enduring symbols of the Cold War.</p><br>
						<p>That night, Premier Khrushchev gave the East German government permission to stop the flow of emigrants by
						closing its border for good. In just two weeks, the East German army, police force and volunteer construction workers
						had completed a makeshift barbed wire and concrete block wall–the Berlin Wall–that divided one side of the city from the other.
						Before the wall was built, Berliners on both sides of the city could move around fairly freely: They crossed the East-West border
						to work, to shop, to go to the theater and the movies. Trains and subway lines carried passengers back and forth. After the wall
						was built, it became impossible to get from East to West Berlin except through one of three checkpoints: at Helmstedt
						("Checkpoint Alpha" in American military parlance), at Dreilinden ("Checkpoint Bravo") and in the center of Berlin at
						Friedrichstrasse ("Checkpoint Charlie"). (Eventually, the GDR built 12 checkpoints along the wall.) At each of the checkpoints,
						East German soldiers screened diplomats and other officials before they were allowed to enter or leave. Except under special circumstances,
						travelers from East and West Berlin were rarely allowed across the border."<p>

						<p>"The construction of the Berlin Wall did stop the flood of refugees from East to West, and it did defuse the crisis over Berlin.
						(Though he was not happy about it, President Kennedy conceded that "a wall is a hell of a lot better than a war.") Over time, East German
						officials replaced the makeshift wall with one that was sturdier and more difficult to scale. A 12-foot-tall, 4-foot-wide mass of reinforced
						concrete was topped with an enormous pipe that made climbing over nearly impossible. Behind the wall on the East German side was a so-called
						"Death Strip": a gauntlet of soft sand (to show footprints), floodlights, vicious dogs, trip-wire machine guns and patrolling soldiers with
						orders to shoot escapees on sight.In all, at least 171 people were killed trying to get over, under or around the Berlin Wall.
						Escape from East Germany was not impossible, however: From 1961 until the wall came down in 1989, more than 5,000 East Germans
						(including some 600 border guards) managed to cross the border by jumping out of windows adjacent to the wall, climbing over the barbed wire,
						flying in hot air balloons, crawling through the sewers and driving through unfortified parts of the wall at high speeds."</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>"At the end of the Second World War, U.S., British, and Soviet military forces divided and occupied Germany. Also divided into occupation zones,
						Berlin was located far inside Soviet-controlled eastern Germany. The United States, United Kingdom, and France controlled western portions of the city,
						while Soviet troops controlled the eastern sector. As the wartime alliance between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union ended and friendly relations
						turned hostile, the question of whether the western occupation zones in Berlin would remain under Western Allied control or whether the city would be absorbed
						into Soviet-controlled eastern Germany led to the first Berlin crisis of the Cold War. The crisis started on June 24, 1948, when Soviet forces blockaded rail,
						road, and water access to Allied-controlled areas of Berlin. The United States and United Kingdom responded by airlifting food and fuel to Berlin from Allied airbases
						in western Germany. The crisis ended on May 12, 1949, when Soviet forces lifted the blockade on land access to western Berlin."</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>"On November 9, 1989, as the Cold War began to thaw across Eastern Europe, the spokesman for East Berlin’s Communist Party announced a change
						in his city’s relations with the West. Starting at midnight that day, he said, citizens of the GDR were free to cross the country’s borders.
						East and West Berliners flocked to the wall, drinking beer and champagne and chanting "Tor auf!" ("Open the gate!"). At midnight, they flooded
						through the checkpoints.More than 2 million people from East Berlin visited West Berlin that weekend to participate in a
						celebration that was, one journalist wrote, "the greatest street party in the history of the world." People used hammers and picks to knock away
						chunks of the wall–they became known as "mauerspechte," or "wall woodpeckers"—while cranes and bulldozers pulled down section after section. Soon
						the wall was gone and Berlin was united for the first time since 1945. "Only today," one Berliner spray-painted on a piece of the wall,is the
						war really over.The reunification of East and West Germany was made official on October 3, 1990, almost one year after the fall of the Berlin Wall."</p>
