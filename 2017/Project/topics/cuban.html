					<blockquote>
						<p>"During the Cuban Missile Crisis, leaders of the U.S. and the Soviet Union engaged in a tense, 13-day political and military standoff in
						October 1962 over the installation of nuclear-armed Soviet missiles on Cuba, just 90 miles from U.S. shores. In a TV address on October 22,
						1962, President John Kennedy (1917-63) notified Americans about the presence of the missiles, explained his decision to enact a naval blockade
						around Cuba and made it clear the U.S. was prepared to use military force if necessary to neutralize this perceived threat to national security.
						Following this news, many people feared the world was on the brink of nuclear war. However, disaster was avoided when the U.S. agreed to Soviet
						leader Nikita Khrushchev’s (1894-1971) offer to remove the Cuban missiles in exchange for the U.S. promising not to invade Cuba. Kennedy also
						secretly agreed to remove U.S. missiles from Turkey."

					<blockquote>
						<p>"No one was sure how Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev would respond to the naval blockade and US demands.
						But the leaders of both superpowers recognized the devastating possibility of a nuclear war and publicly agreed to a
						deal in which the Soviets would dismantle the weapon sites in exchange for a pledge from the United States not to invade
						Cuba. In a separate deal, which remained secret for more than twenty-five years, the United States also agreed to remove
						its nuclear missiles from Turkey. Although the Soviets removed their missiles from Cuba, they escalated the building of their military arsenal;
						the missile crisis was over, the arms race was not."</p>

				<h2 id="ending">Ending</h2>
					<blockquote>
						<p>"The Cuban missile crisis stands as a singular event during the Cold War and strengthened Kennedy’s
						image domestically and internationally. It also may have helped mitigate negative world opinion regarding
						the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. Two other important results of the crisis came in unique forms. First, despite
						the flurry of direct and indirect communications between the White House and the Kremlin—perhaps because of it—Kennedy
						and Khrushchev, and their advisers, struggled throughout the crisis to clearly understand each others’ true intentions,
						while the world hung on the brink of possible nuclear war. In an effort to prevent this from happening again, a direct telephone
						link between the White House and the Kremlin was established; it became known as the "Hotline." Second, having approached the brink
						of nuclear conflict, both superpowers began to reconsider the nuclear arms race and took the first steps in agreeing to a nuclear Test Ban Treaty."</p>
